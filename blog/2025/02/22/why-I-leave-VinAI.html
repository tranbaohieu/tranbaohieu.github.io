<p>Finally, I have done some things. The last three months have been the craziest for me. In November of last year, I decided to quit my job at VinAI Research, the top AI company in Vietnam, and also my dream company when I was a college student. But why? Recently, I still ask myself, “Why did I leave VinAI?” I really do not know what I was thinking three months ago, but I know I had a strong motivation to change, so I chose to change my job.</p>

<p>In early 2024, I joined a research team to study Mamba, a novel model that was really hot at that time. But six months passed, and we did not create anything significant. However, in an experiment unrelated to Mamba, we figured out that no matter what model you use, looping the model can improve extrapolation. This phenomenon has been studied in some previous research papers, but we have started developing a method to determine how long looping is enough.</p>

<p>At the same time, I had some personal issues, so I decided to spend full time researching and working at my favorite coffee shop. I just told myself, “You spent nearly four years as an engineer. It’s time for your passion, for being who you want to be, for doing what you want to do. You can afford this for at least a few months—that should be enough.”</p>

<p>I told my wife about my plan to quit my job and assured her, “I can always go back to being an engineer at any time. Right now, I just want to see how far I can go.” My friends suggested that I should do my research while still working as an engineer at VinAI. My salary at VinAI was good, and if I quit immediately, I would lose all my bonuses from last year and my December salary. Unfortunately, I am the kind of person who can only focus on one thing at a time. So I quit my job and awkwardly labeled myself as an “Independent Researcher” on ArXiv. But honestly, you can call me a jobless man or a chill guy—it’s all the same.</p>

<p>After two months of being jobless, I did many experiments and got some positive results. But on the other hand, my wife and I started to see our savings dwindle. I needed to find a new job. So, in the last month, I did many interviews—so many that my wife said, “You talk to interviewers more than you talk to me.” I got four or five offers from foreign companies and big Vietnamese corporations. The only company—and also the last company I applied to—that gave me an offer allowed me to continue doing research, was near my home, and provided me with a salary enough to pay my house loan. Phew…</p>

<p>On the other hand, our research was completed last week. We wrote a paper and submitted it to a conference. Before writing this paper, we were concerned about where we should submit it, but in the end, honestly, we just cared about completing it. I also made our research public on ArXiv. I know I still need to do many experiments for the rebuttal round. I know that from tomorrow, I will have to get used to a new working environment.</p>

<p>But for now, finally, I have a free day. I don’t need to do any more interviews, and next week I don’t have any deadlines. Phewwwwww…</p>

<p>Through all of this, I still kept running every day—I completed 80 km last month.</p>
